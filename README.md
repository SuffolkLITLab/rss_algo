# RSS Algo

The RSS algo lives on your device with your data. We make use of a proxy server to help facilitate access to feeds. So we know some of the feeds folks are consuming, but at least for vistors to https://suffolklitlab.org/rss_algo/ we don't use tracking tools that drop cookies like Google Anaylitics (the rest of `https://suffolklitlab.org/` is [another matter](https://suffolklitlab.org/terms/)). Most importantly, all of your votes and views live in your browser. We just lunched and we're still woking things out (e.g., the recomendation algo can be greatly improved), but if you don't mind the spase documenation and a few bugs from time to time, feel free to play around.

# Troubleshooting

Make sure that your url is a properly formated url (e.g. `https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml`). More suggestions coming soon.
