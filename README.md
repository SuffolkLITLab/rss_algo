# RSS Algo

The RSS algo lives on your device with your data. We make use of a proxy server to help facilitate access to feeds. So we know some of the feeds folks are consuming, but at least for vistors to https://suffolklitlab.org/rss_algo/ we don't use tracking tools that drop cookies like Google Anaylitics (the rest of `https://suffolklitlab.org/` is [another matter](https://suffolklitlab.org/terms/)). Most importantly, all of your votes and views live in your browser. We just lunched and we're still woking things out (e.g., the recomendation algo can be greatly improved), but if you don't mind the sparse documenation and a few bugs from time to time, feel free to play around.

# Notes on RSS Feeds

It's harder to find RSS feeds now than it was 20 years ago. So, here are a few tips and tricks. 

If you're looking for local news in the US, you can probably find a [Patch.com](https://patch.com/) feed. They aren't listed anywhere, but are of the form `https://patch.com/feeds/aol/massachusetts/boston`. So you can try swapping out your state and locality names. This is a common theme, websites with RSS feeds but no clear way of discovering them. My goto method for finding a site's feed has three main steps: 

1. See if you can find the letters RSS anywhere on the site. These often link right to the feed (e.g., [Pluralistic](https://pluralistic.net/) has an [RSS link](https://pluralistic.net/feed/) right in the menu. You'll probably want to `right click > copy link` to get the url as clicking on the link often triggers a download. If that doesn't work...
2. Google `[website name] RSS feeds` and see if anything comes up. If you're lucky, you'll get results like these:
    - [RSS Feeds - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/rss)
    - [RSS Feeds - The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/about/feeds?verso=true)
    - [RSS Feeds | Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/rss-feeds/)
    - [RSS Feeds | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/about/rss-feeds/)
    - [Slateâ€™s RSS feeds.](https://slate.com/rss)
3. And if you can't find anything that way, you're best bet is viewing a webpage's source (`right click + view source` in most browsers). This will open a text file where you can look a link ending in `.rss`. Here, `Control/Command + F` is your friend.  

# Troubleshooting

Make sure that your url is a properly formated url (e.g. `https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml`). More suggestions coming soon.
